Introduction
------------

OGDL ("Ordered Graph Data Language") is a structured textual format that
represents information in the form of graphs, where the nodes are strings
and the arcs or edges are spaces or indentation.

The OGDL package consists of the "libogdl" C library and following tools:
  - gpath     (Graph path resolver for OGDL streams)
  - xml2ogdl  (XML to OGDL converter)
  - tindent   (simple indentation tool)
